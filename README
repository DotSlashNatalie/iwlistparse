This is used to parse the output from iwlist scan
ie

iwlist wlan0 scan | python iwlistparse.py

Sample output:

7E:85:2A:A6:C0:D8 - 2.412 GHz (Channel 1) - 30/70  Signal level=-80 dBm - xfinitywifi
DC:EF:09:83:B9:E3 - 2.412 GHz (Channel 1) - 70/70  Signal level=-38 dBm - NETGEAR46

You can use the watch command to continuously run it -
watch -n 1 'iwlist wlan0 scan | python iwlistparse.py'

If you would like it to modified to be in a more consumable/queryable format (ie CSV or SQL)
please contact me
